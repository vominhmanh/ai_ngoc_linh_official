The presenter faces the camera (front view), standing tall with a gentle, graceful shift in posture to suggest slight movement. Shoulder-length straight black hair. Cheerful, friendly expression. Wearing a traditional Vietnamese áo dài in bright red with a single large five-point yellow star centered on the chest; flowing panels and simple matching pants. Seamless white studio background. Professional soft key light with subtle rim light, natural skin tones, crisp focus from head to toe. Vertical portrait composition, subject centered, entire body in frame. High dynamic range, ultra-detailed, 4K. No text, no logos, no watermark.\",\n",
    "    \"prompt\": \"Create an empty indoor TV news studio inspired by modern Vietnamese national television sets — no logos or text. Ultra-wide panoramic view that captures the entire studio in a 16:9 frame (3840×2160). Cinematic wide-angle lens (≈16–20 mm full-frame). A luxurious, contemporary stage made of modern materials (brushed metal, glass, polished stone, warm wood accents). A long, curved LED wall runs across the stage in a wide arc; its height is exactly half the stage height. Place a long anchor desk close to the LED wall; the LED wall is clearly taller than the desk. Leave a generous open floor area in front of the desk large enough for multiple people to stand. Clean broadcast lighting with soft overhead grids, subtle rim and floor reflections; neutral white balance. Composition centered and symmetrical with clear leading lines. Photorealistic, HDR, ultra-detailed, 4K. No people, no watermarks, no extra text.\",\n",
